To guide you through depositing and withdrawing Ethereum (ETH) between the Ethereum blockchain and Internet Computer (ICP) using Chain Key Ethereum (ckETH), I will break it down into three sections:

Step-by-step tutorial – Detailed instructions for depositing and withdrawing ETH using ckETH.
Basic Frontend – A simple frontend that lets you perform these actions.
Repository Setup – A GitHub repository with working code for reference.
1. Step-by-step Tutorial
Before you begin, you need to be familiar with a few core concepts:

Chain Key Ethereum (ckETH): ckETH is a token representation of ETH on the Internet Computer (ICP). It allows users to bridge ETH from Ethereum to ICP, providing similar value and utility on ICP as ETH does on Ethereum.

ICP Wallet: You’ll need an ICP wallet that supports ckETH, such as Plug Wallet or Stoic Wallet.

MetaMask: A widely used Ethereum wallet that we’ll use for interacting with Ethereum.

Prerequisites
MetaMask Installed: Set up MetaMask with your Ethereum account.
ICP Wallet: Install and set up Plug Wallet or Stoic Wallet for your ICP account.
Node.js and npm: Install Node.js and npm for building the frontend application.
GitHub Account: You'll need a GitHub account to clone the repository and interact with the code.
